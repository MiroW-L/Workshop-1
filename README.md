# Workshop-1

## Work made for Workshop 1 (14/1/25)
random(0,width), means that a number will be randomly selected for a function which Leo explained which I thought was cool.
Here are my attempts to use it with a function.

I am struggling to use p5.js and generating my Flowers, I will contact Leo because I don't understand what I'm doing wrong and it's making me mad.
I asked Sienna for some help as well as rewatching the class viideo again and looking into some resources

This is what I have gotten done so far but I will be moving onto the next workshop to try get my mind on something else.

### Finishing Up (20/1/25)
Luckily I emailed Leo about it and he sent me back an edited version of my own coding which was very helpful as I compared the two (my version and his) and felt like I understood where I had gone wrong.

## My broken piece of coding

## The work Leo edited, note the difference in using a "for" variable as well as changing the placement of lots of the actions and statements in the order of the script


## Reflection

- I've linked all the works I've done with this piece as well as Leos version which I tinkered with a little to explore what could be further done with my flower idea. I think it's quite complicated to get the result I want with the limited skills I have at the moment but this might be something worth revisiting in a later workshop.
- Some trouble I ran into was trying to get the new finished version website upload is I had accidentally pasted my simplified original version over the top of the completeled version, luckily I just pasted it in one more time and that sorted things out.

## A horrible sight, thank goodness I figured out what to do!
