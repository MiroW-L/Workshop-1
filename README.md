# Workshop-1

## Work made for Workshop 1 (14/1/25)
random(0,width), means that a number will be randomly selected for a function which Leo explained which I thought was cool.
Here are my attempts to use it with a function.

I am struggling to use p5.js and generating my Flowers, I will contact Leo because I don't understand what I'm doing wrong and it's making me mad.
I asked Sienna for some help as well as rewatching the class viideo again and looking into some resources

This is what I have gotten done so far but I will be moving onto the next workshop to try get my mind on something else.

Luckily I emailed Leo about it and he sent me back an edited version of my own coding which was very helpful as I compared the two and felt like I understood where I had gone wrong. I've linked all the works I've done with this piece as well as Leos version which I tinkered with a little to explore what could be further done with my flower idea. I think it's quite complicated to get the result I want with the limited skills I have at the moment but this might  be something worth revisiting in a later workshop.
